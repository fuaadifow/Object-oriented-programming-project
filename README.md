Complete the class named StringCases, which includes five methods that take
in a parameter of type String. Each method returns a String that corresponds to
the inputString converted to the naming convention specified by the method name.
Note that only the letters are considered for conversion, other characters should be
ignored and not copied in the generated String. For alternateCase(), the letters
on odd positions in the generated string are capitalised, while the letters on even
positions are in lower case.
Example of conversion to alternateCase using the inputString “The price is
$645!”: “ThEpRiCeIs”.
Examples of outputs for the inputString “Hello, how are you?” using different
cases:
• camelCase(): “helloHowAreYou”
• pascalCase(): “HelloHowAreYou”
• snakeCase(): “hello how are you”
• screamingSnakeCase(): “HELLO HOW ARE YOU”
• alternateCase(): “HeLlOhOwArEyOu”
